            <p>reading response: form+code - raes</p><br>
            <p>I thought it was really interesting to be reminded of how different types of code exist around us in our lives because I have become more accustomed recently to thinking about code in the context of computers only. For example genetic code, health and safety codes, secret codes, etc. It was a reminder of how these sort of rules-based structures make up so of our world and I think it's interesting that rules and instructions are not only created/imposed by humans (like health and safety codes) but also exist in nature, which we think of as being organic, and with which we can't always immediately see with our naked eye the underlying processes that determine the outcome of some kind of algorithm (for example growth and decay).</p><br>
            <p>I thought it was also helpful to think about different kinds of algorithms that exist around us outside of computing, for example with knitting instructions as as well assembling kit-of-parts furniture. Something else that stood out to me was the discussion of code as language, and how programming languages are designed with human language in mind. While this makes sense, it made me think about different kinds of languages, for example right-to-left reading, or vertical reading languages, and how people who grow up speaking these languages learn and engage with code.</p><br>
            <p>Another thing that struck me was the discussion about how computers can only understand code when it is written in a very specific way (for example it cannot understand misspelled words), in contrast to humans who can still interpret language in various forms - I thought about AI and machine learning and I wonder whether if in the future computers will be able to read code like humans can read language, whether they will be able to adapt to things like spelling mistakes and things like that.</p>

            <p>reading response: franke - computer art</p><br>
            <p>I thought the reading provided an interesting perspective from the time when “computer technology” was just starting to be used and its potential for creating graphics was starting to be realized. I think it's interesting to think about the technological constraints and the advantages provided by this new technology at the time and the outputs that resulted. It's also interesting to think about how now it is so easy to “draw” shapes using software like Illustrator, but it requires a different way of thinking to draw even simple shapes using code and libraries such as p5.</p><br>
            <p>There was a lot in the reading that I thought would be interesting to explore further, one example was the discussion of chance and the means of introducing “genuine chance” using external processes found in nature - for example the decay process of a radioactive element (40). In thinking about my project I think it would be interesting to think about different ways of introducing chance to generate outcomes. I think overall the reading was really helpful in showing examples of how these different kinds of outputs could be created and with what methodologies. I was drawn to the work of Vilko Ziljak because it was reminiscent to me of some of the works I’ve seen on art blocks though from a much earlier time.</p>

            <p>reading response: conditional design - moniker</p><br>
            <p>I thought the discussion of subjectivity in conditional design and conceptual art was interesting, as well as the question of where control lives in an open system. I think sometimes designers are viewed as being solely responsible for the final outcome of any work or project, whereas Blauvelt's piece talks about the notion of external factors contributing to “inputs” in the context of design, and how inputs “should come from our external and complex environment: nature, society, and its human interactions.” I liked his discussion about open versus closed systems, and how much more (almost infinite) potential an open system has, where inputs can come from other users and not just one single person. I think the shift towards more open systems is exciting, as well as the idea of contemporary design as making “tools that enable others to use design.” The idea of one single person or designer making every single decision about a work or project feels so limited and restricted in these discussions of open systems and I think there is something very appealing about relinquishing some of that control to the process.</p><br>
            <p>I thought the text by Koert van Mensvoort also provided an interesting perspective of the fictional city of Zhiango as a success story of conditional design. It was interesting to think about the potential for conditional design in urban planning and how the idea of control, or lack thereof, could lead to more positive outcomes than something “100% planned.” I also liked the connection between this text and the previous one in how they both highlight the value of the process as opposed to a single fixed outcome.</p>

            <p>reading response: game design - habraken</p><br>
            <p>It was really interesting to think about the idea of control in the context of games and how it relates to being a designer. While I know that there are game designers and designing games is an entire world and field in and of itself, I think this reading was the first time that I really thought about the connection between games and designing in general. I was reminded of collaborative work, especially now with tools like Figma or even Github which allows people to simultaneously work on the same project.</p><br>
            <p>The idea of “the physical designer’s skill [resting] on the ability to convey projected spatial arrangements through descriptions” was also interesting because I think it relates pretty directly to our recent experiment of designing instructions which presented various challenges in terms of how “accurately” others might interpret our intentions. I was also reminded of the idea of design systems particularly for branding, and how these are also in a sense instructions for people to follow with a level of specificity determined by the designer. The challenge here I think is also in how clear the system or guidelines are and how easy the system is for anybody to implement when the original designer is no longer overseeing it. I think these examples ultimately also all come back to the idea of communication, which is obviously at the root of what we study, which is communication design - how clearly can we communicate our intentions so that others may receive our message. </p>

            <p>p2 - revised instructions</p><br>
            <p>based on feedback from last class i revised my instructions, clarifying some steps and also changing some of the directions completely. for my 1st set of instructions, I modified the starting "grid" template to be more open while still maintaining consistency, as well as trying to eliminate sources of confusion (with unused points on the grid). I also brought color into the choice of medium which was suggested to make it more interesting.</p><br>
            <p>For the instructions 2 and 3, I decided to come up with new instructions as my first draft instructions were kind of similar to each other.</p><br>

            <p>e2 - instructions for paper</p><br>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I found in working on the instructions was controlling the variability in the outcomes. I think the more specific an outcome that I had in mind the more challenging it was to write the instructions in a way that another person would understand and interpret them the same way that I would. On the other hand I think it would be interesting to see how people might interpret a more open ended set of instructions, or perhaps some more poetic set of instructions like in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit. For my instructions, I decided to try and allow for some variability while still trying to create a sort of “template” or structure as a base for each execution.</p><br><hr><br>
            <p>Directions 1<br><br>

              1. Draw a “grid” of 5 dots by 5 dots in the middle of your paper (roughly the width of your hand). Do not connect any points yet.<br><br>
              2. Starting from the top left dot and working clockwise around the 4 sides of your grid, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1, to create an “outline” of dots.<br><br>
              3. Choose a dot on the top edge of your grid. Draw a line from this dot to every dot on the opposite side of your grid.<br><br>
              4. Choose a dot on the right edge of your grid. Draw a line from this dot to each dot on the opposite side.<br><br>
              5. Repeat for the bottom edge and finally the left edge.</p><br><hr><br>
              <p>Directions 2<br><br>

                1. Draw a “grid” of 5 dots by 5 dots in the middle of your paper (roughly the width of your hand). Do not connect any points yet.<br><br>
                2. Starting from the top left dot and working only horizontally, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1 (only horizontally). You should now have 5 rows of 17 dots.
                <br><br>
                3. Starting at the top left dot, connect each dot in in row 1 to another dot in row 2.<br><br>
                4. Repeat step 3, connecting every dot in row 2 to another dot in row 3, row 3 to row 4, and row 4 to row 5.
              </p><br><hr><br>
              <p>Directions 3<br><br>

                1. Draw a 4x4 grid of dots in the middle of your paper (a little smaller than the width of your hand).<br><br>
                2. Starting from the top left dot and working only horizontally, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1 (only horizontally). You should now have 4 rows of 13 dots.
                <br><br>
                3. Draw a diagonal line connecting one dot in row 1 to another dot in row 2.<br><br>
                4. Draw a diagonal line going in the opposite direction connecting the same dot in row 2 to another dot in row 3 to create a zig zag.<br><br>
                5. Repeat step 4 connecting the dot in row 3 to a dot in row 4.
                <br><br>
                6. Connect the outermost dots to create an outline of your grid.
                <br><br>
                7. Draw parallel zig-zag lines only to the right of your original zig-zag, using the dots you drew to evenly space the lines. Each line should be contained within the outline of your grid.<br><br>

            <p>jodi's infrastructure</p><br>
            <p>A line from the reading that I liked was”…the texture of code and computation takes over, and computing itself—its strange logic, its grammar and structure, and often its shape and color—produces the aesthetic,” in contrast to the idea of the artists' “subjective impulses” shaping the aesthetic of their work. Something that I find interesting about coding and working with mediums that I am less familiar with is being able to produce outcomes that I was not able to preconceive. This passage reminded me of working with code and seeing things in the console that I was not expecting, and I think it's cool that coding can produce outcomes that we as humans cannot create on our own.</p><br>
            <p>What interests me about the idea of 'generativity' is that it addresses something that I struggle with at times, which is making decisions about certain kinds of things. The idea of creating some kind of a system that reduces the need for “subjective impulses” or certain kinds of decision making is appealing in that it seems liberating in a way.</p><br>
            <p>I think it was really cool how Jodi used the infrastructure of the web in their work in ways I haven't seen before or even knew was possible. An example is their emoji animation in the browser address bar which reminded me of the Touch Bar on MacBook Pros. I learned something new because I never knew unicode characters could be used in domain names.

            <p>j.r. carpenter || a handmade web</p><br>
            <p>i liked how this reading talked about the intimacy of the handmade web page, and the idea of building a web page as a "craft" and "manual labor" - i felt it was particularly resonant as i was working on this web page because it took me a lot longer than i thought it would to achieve something that seems very simple and i found myself reworking things over and over again.</p><br>
            <p>also about the idea of manual labor, the surf-club reading made me think about how algorithms changed the way we "surf" the web, where everything is more spoonfed to us now. it reminded me that there was more of a sense of being able to get lost in the web that there is less of today.</p><br>
            <p>what i thought was also interesting from the surf-club reading was the contrast between the web today and the web in the early 2000s, especially the idea of ownership and what is public versus what is private on the web. i'm interested in learning more about NFTs and blockchain technology because admittedly i get confused, and i thought it was interesting how the idea of ownership has evolved.
