            <p>It was interesting to read about the relationship between art and technology and the way it has been perceived over time. While there is always opportunity and new potential with technological advancements, as the reading notes, there is also a “darker side” to any new technologies, such as how these can be used for “subjugation as much as improvements to daily life.” Of course there is always the inequities associated with such developments and who gets to appreciate these technologies and who gets left out, as well as the false promise of “universality.” The “two-sided” nature of technology was also highlighted in the discussion about screens as being both a surface that “arrests light” such as in cinema, while also serving as a medium “on which information is written.”</p><br>
            <p>I thought the discussion of the Law of Relocation was interesting because it felt relevant to those of use who are students and learning new media and how we can apply them to our own work, particularly coding. A line from the reading that stood out to me was “those who produce so-called 'computer graphic' images, by manipulating synthetic fractal and images, usually fall into the trap of illustration.” I find that a challenge for myself when learning new technologies, and in this class, coding in particular, is in taking something that may already exist (for example some source code that was written by someone else) and doing something completely new with it. Of course it is that much more rewarding the farther away your own work moves from the source code you may have started with.</p><br>
            <p>I also thought the discussion of “synthetic imagery” was interesting, and how it differs from prior artistic mediums because it is no longer about the human hand or “gestures” as the reading states. I found it relevant to this class because what we have been doing is essentially in a way creating systems that can create images for us, rather than individually creating 100 different outputs on our own. In this way I thought that the line “the contemporary image is typified precisely by its generative power” was resonant, and it has been a challenging but cool change of pace to step back and let the code do the work for us. To close I think that the relationship between art and technology is one that I would love to continue to explore further, and the line from the reading that “art's function” is “to reverse the authority of technology in order to make ways of thinking, living, and seeing creative” is something that we can take with us as we continue to incorporate new media and new technologies into our own practices moving forward.</p>

            <p>I thought this week's reading provided a really interesting discussion of the scale of impact of automation on our lives and in the world. I think it was particularly relevant given the shifts that we all see today with respect to work and society, and education as well. One theme in the reading that struck me was the tension and contrast between the specialist, fragmented aspects of the mechanical age and the generalist, interconnected aspects of the electric age. In a previous UX class, we learned about the benefits of being a generalist versus a specialist in the field, which struck me because I used to think that specialists were more “valued”. However, this makes sense when thinking about our world today through the lens of of the electric age and it's “all-at-once” or interrelated/interdependent aspects, which reveal how knowledge cannot be isolated to one subject without an understanding of its relations to other subjects.</p><br>
            <p>The discussion of learning and education in the context of the electric age was also interesting. I found it resonated particularly today and in the age of Covid, where people have reconsidered their careers or gone back to school, or took classes on their own using the many resources that are available to us now for self-learning even through YouTube or even Tik Tok. It is interesting to think about how Wikipedia and even Google search was discouraged or even prohibited from being used as a source for research in school, but now “learning how to Google” is actually skill that we rely on today. With so many resources available to us online, from tutorials to complete courses, it was interesting that the reading pointed out that teachers are “the largest employee group in the US and may well become the only group”, especially as teachers are historically undervalued and underpaid in schools today. It is interesting that the electric age has both created new things to learn but also allows us to learn new things by allowing us to access more information which then results in more new technologies, jobs, etc.</p><br>
            <p>Something else that stood out to me was when McLuhan refers to the “specter” of joblessness and propertylessness in the electric age, which made me think of political discussions of joblessness and unemployment in America. The metric of unemployment is always used as a cudgel to “convince” voters that only one party is capable of creating jobs, and automation is demonized as taking away people's jobs, rather than viewed, as McLuhan describes, as a model for society. The discussion of “total interdependence” was also interesting to me, along with his discussion of war, and how it becomes “impracticable” with electric speed “because organic interdependence means that disruption of any part of the organism can prove fatal to the whole.” It makes me wonder when people may view or when politicians may think to brand automation as a tool to be leveraged rather than something to “panic” about.</p>

            <p>I think people often mistake artificial intelligence or algorithms as being devoid of any human intervention, which I think is sometimes part of the design (like with big tech), however it was interesting to read about the many different ways in which automation is grounded and shaped by human forces behind the scenes. I thought that Sanela Jahic's approach to her project Digital Punch Card was interesting because she used metadata to give more context and life to a mostly “invisible” workforce, subverting the “myth of automation.” In the context of our own projects and others we have looked at in class, something that comes to mind is the idea of process versus the final output, and I think this reading reinforced the idea that even behind “generative” works or works based on algorithms, there are human-made decisions that shape what may often be considered to be just “computer-generated” art.</p><br>
            <p>The discussion of the Facial Action Coding System and James Bridle's remarks about bias in artificial intelligence and datasets also brought to mind the ways in which big tech has produced problematic outcomes, like racial bias in healthcare algorithms, for example. It brought to mind the ways that representation (or lack thereof) in big tech has very real world implications that can have enormous consequences for already underserved, underrepresented, or otherwise marginalized communities.</p><br>
            <p>Finally, I thought that the discussion of “laziness” in contrast to hyperemployment was interesting especially given the way that the notion of work has changed so dramatically since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. It made me think about how we measure productivity, and how the shift to working from home has proven that physically being at work does not equate to being productive. It also made me think about the irony of the idea of laziness or automation, especially in the context of Mladen Stilinovic's “Demand Full Laziness,” which juxtaposed images of laziness with all of the work that went into producing those images. The idea of a post-work society is fascinating and scary at the same time, as the Oblomo project showed, and I think something that is on a lot of people's minds is what jobs will be replaced by automation in the future, even coding. Thinking about reverie versus hyperemployment, perhaps the fear of losing jobs doesn't need to be so much a fear as an opportunity for something different.</p>

            <p>It was interesting to read about NFTs in the context of Marcel Duchamp's readymades. As someone who is still wrapping his head around NFTs, the contrast between NFTs and Duchamp's work provided a new perspective. A line that stood out to me was “With the readymade, Duchamp gave sculpture over to information on two registers: He desublimated matter by suspending it between two names, shovel and sculpture; and he abandoned objects for discourse.” The discussion of “information,” struck me in the context of how we are now living in the information age, and Duchamp's work was about ideas or “information” as opposed to about the materiality of the objects themselves. It was interesting to read then how NFTs are in a way the reverse, where digital files that don't exist as material objects in the physical world are assigned value.</p><br>
            <p>It was also interesting to read about the discussion of matter as property, and the “aesthetics” of the relationships between the two. I was struck by the line about how “the NFT is a social contract that values property over material experience” and how “that contract can be broken.” It made me think about the popularity of NFTs and the question of their longevity and their precarious status. I feel that discussions of cryptocurrency are always divided between enthusiasts and those who are skeptical about their long term value and the idea of an NFT as a social contract that can be broken to me adds to my skeptical side, that if enough people begin to question the idea of valuing “property” over “material experience,” then maybe the popularity of NFTs will begin to wane as well, although of course, as the reading says, “the market will do what the market will do.”</p>

            <p>It was interesting to read about the “medium” of software and how that can take on many different forms, especially the discussion of the PGP software being published as a book, which had different rules governing its publication and dissemination. It reminded me of the NFT websites that publish the source code as opposed to just the image of the work itself. It was a reminder of how different contexts can assign different value to the work itself.</p><br>
            <p>The discussion of the evolution of how software was released to the public through magazines was interesting as well. The idea of disseminating software as printed code that people could write on their own, and the process of typing it in, using trial and error to fix mistakes, reminds me of how we learn to code today, which I know for me has consisted of a lot of trial and error and learning by doing.</p><br>
            <p>The idea of technological advancements driving and shaping the delivery of software also struck me, in a similar way to the idea that technology shapes aesthetics in design as well (for example from printed type to digital type). The obsolescence of technology - for example, diskettes from the 80s not working today, though printed source code would still be able to be read and retyped today, also struck me, as well as the irony of a completely worthless material having more longevity than “newer” technologies. This double edged sword and the idea of backwards compatibility also reminded me of how javascript was designed to be backwards compatible so that any code ever written from its inception would always be able to work with any future updates.</p><br>
            <p>Finally I thought the discussion of preservation was interesting because I think normally we think of it as preserving the one original thing, whereas here it was more about the content of what we are preserving, almost as if preservation doesn't have any meaning unless the thing being preserved reaches as many people as possible. In other words, what good is a preserved object locked away if no one can see it. It made me think of copyright laws and how we assign value to things that are hard to assign a monetary value to, when they are freely shared and decentralized. Maybe that is where the discussion of NFTs comes in to play as well.</p>

            <p>reading response: information ages - hobart</p><br>
            <p>I enjoyed this reading's discussion of the play in the context of information technology, and the distinction between what we think of as frivolous play versus something that allows us to engage with information in a deeper way. It was interesting to think about the idea of play as something that, in the words of Johan Huizinga, is governed by “rules freely accepted but absolutely binding” which at first seems like a contradiction, but makes sense in the context of computers which are governed by the “absolutely binding logical rules of information processing.”</p><br>
            <p>I thought it was also interesting to think of computers as toys, because they have become relatively so simple to use that they allow us to remain ignorant of what goes on under the hood to power our everyday tasks. The historical context of computer technology reminds us of how quickly and how far they have come, as today we take for granted how much our lives and the “human experience”, as the reading puts it, has become digitized. The line “we engross ourselves in these activities simply because we can” struck me because of both the perils of how easily and readily we become consumed by our devices, social media, etc., but also because of the potential for new learning. The reading discusses how a deeper dimension of play is complexity, and how information in the contemporary age is an “ongoing, playful activity, time- and place-bound, teeming with local rather than universal truths.” This passage, and the discussion of “chaos” and “complexity” reminded me of prior readings and the idea of conditional design, which rely not on fixed, predictable outcomes but a process that also takes into account “inputs” from the environment.</p><br>
            <p>Something that I took from the reading is how the advancement of technology allows us to do complex things in a simple way that almost becomes rote. I think about kids who grow up today not knowing life without computers, and it is interesting but also scary to think about how this merging of the human experience and technology is something that has become second nature to us. At the same time I think there is exciting potential for what can happen when “we engross ourselves in these activities simply because we can,” and these “activities” involve discovering new outcomes that we otherwise could not without the help of computers. Something that came to mind was how p5 makes it easier for us to create visual drawings using code, something that we might not otherwise do. I think it's cool to think about play as a tool for innovation and discovery.</p>

            <p>I thought it was really interesting to be reminded of how different types of code exist around us in our lives because I have become more accustomed recently to thinking about code in the context of computers only. For example genetic code, health and safety codes, secret codes, etc. It was a reminder of how these sort of rules-based structures make up so of our world and I think it's interesting that rules and instructions are not only created/imposed by humans (like health and safety codes) but also exist in nature, which we think of as being organic, and with which we can't always immediately see with our naked eye the underlying processes that determine the outcome of some kind of algorithm (for example growth and decay).</p><br>
            <p>I thought it was also helpful to think about different kinds of algorithms that exist around us outside of computing, for example with knitting instructions as as well assembling kit-of-parts furniture. Something else that stood out to me was the discussion of code as language, and how programming languages are designed with human language in mind. While this makes sense, it made me think about different kinds of languages, for example right-to-left reading, or vertical reading languages, and how people who grow up speaking these languages learn and engage with code.</p><br>
            <p>Another thing that struck me was the discussion about how computers can only understand code when it is written in a very specific way (for example it cannot understand misspelled words), in contrast to humans who can still interpret language in various forms - I thought about AI and machine learning and I wonder whether if in the future computers will be able to read code like humans can read language, whether they will be able to adapt to things like spelling mistakes and things like that.</p>

            <p>I thought the reading provided an interesting perspective from the time when “computer technology” was just starting to be used and its potential for creating graphics was starting to be realized. I think it's interesting to think about the technological constraints and the advantages provided by this new technology at the time and the outputs that resulted. It's also interesting to think about how now it is so easy to “draw” shapes using software like Illustrator, but it requires a different way of thinking to draw even simple shapes using code and libraries such as p5.</p><br>
            <p>There was a lot in the reading that I thought would be interesting to explore further, one example was the discussion of chance and the means of introducing “genuine chance” using external processes found in nature - for example the decay process of a radioactive element (40). In thinking about my project I think it would be interesting to think about different ways of introducing chance to generate outcomes. I think overall the reading was really helpful in showing examples of how these different kinds of outputs could be created and with what methodologies. I was drawn to the work of Vilko Ziljak because it was reminiscent to me of some of the works I’ve seen on art blocks though from a much earlier time.</p>

            <p>reading response: conditional design - moniker</p><br>
            <p>I thought the discussion of subjectivity in conditional design and conceptual art was interesting, as well as the question of where control lives in an open system. I think sometimes designers are viewed as being solely responsible for the final outcome of any work or project, whereas Blauvelt's piece talks about the notion of external factors contributing to “inputs” in the context of design, and how inputs “should come from our external and complex environment: nature, society, and its human interactions.” I liked his discussion about open versus closed systems, and how much more (almost infinite) potential an open system has, where inputs can come from other users and not just one single person. I think the shift towards more open systems is exciting, as well as the idea of contemporary design as making “tools that enable others to use design.” The idea of one single person or designer making every single decision about a work or project feels so limited and restricted in these discussions of open systems and I think there is something very appealing about relinquishing some of that control to the process.</p><br>
            <p>I thought the text by Koert van Mensvoort also provided an interesting perspective of the fictional city of Zhiango as a success story of conditional design. It was interesting to think about the potential for conditional design in urban planning and how the idea of control, or lack thereof, could lead to more positive outcomes than something “100% planned.” I also liked the connection between this text and the previous one in how they both highlight the value of the process as opposed to a single fixed outcome.</p>

            <p>It was really interesting to think about the idea of control in the context of games and how it relates to being a designer. While I know that there are game designers and designing games is an entire world and field in and of itself, I think this reading was the first time that I really thought about the connection between games and designing in general. I was reminded of collaborative work, especially now with tools like Figma or even Github which allows people to simultaneously work on the same project.</p><br>
            <p>The idea of “the physical designer’s skill [resting] on the ability to convey projected spatial arrangements through descriptions” was also interesting because I think it relates pretty directly to our recent experiment of designing instructions which presented various challenges in terms of how “accurately” others might interpret our intentions. I was also reminded of the idea of design systems particularly for branding, and how these are also in a sense instructions for people to follow with a level of specificity determined by the designer. The challenge here I think is also in how clear the system or guidelines are and how easy the system is for anybody to implement when the original designer is no longer overseeing it. I think these examples ultimately also all come back to the idea of communication, which is obviously at the root of what we study, which is communication design - how clearly can we communicate our intentions so that others may receive our message. </p>

            <p>based on feedback from last class i revised my instructions, clarifying some steps and also changing some of the directions completely. for my 1st set of instructions, I modified the starting "grid" template to be more open while still maintaining consistency, as well as trying to eliminate sources of confusion (with unused points on the grid). I also brought color into the choice of medium which was suggested to make it more interesting.</p><br>
            <p>For the instructions 2 and 3, I decided to come up with new instructions as my first draft instructions were kind of similar to each other.</p><br>
            <p>revised instructions:</p><br>

            <p>e2 - instructions for paper</p><br>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I found in working on the instructions was controlling the variability in the outcomes. I think the more specific an outcome that I had in mind the more challenging it was to write the instructions in a way that another person would understand and interpret them the same way that I would. On the other hand I think it would be interesting to see how people might interpret a more open ended set of instructions, or perhaps some more poetic set of instructions like in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit. For my instructions, I decided to try and allow for some variability while still trying to create a sort of “template” or structure as a base for each execution.</p><br><hr><br>
            <p>Directions 1<br><br>

              1. Draw a “grid” of 5 dots by 5 dots in the middle of your paper (roughly the width of your hand). Do not connect any points yet.<br><br>
              2. Starting from the top left dot and working clockwise around the 4 sides of your grid, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1, to create an “outline” of dots.<br><br>
              3. Choose a dot on the top edge of your grid. Draw a line from this dot to every dot on the opposite side of your grid.<br><br>
              4. Choose a dot on the right edge of your grid. Draw a line from this dot to each dot on the opposite side.<br><br>
              5. Repeat for the bottom edge and finally the left edge.</p><br><hr><br>
              <p>Directions 2<br><br>

                1. Draw a “grid” of 5 dots by 5 dots in the middle of your paper (roughly the width of your hand). Do not connect any points yet.<br><br>
                2. Starting from the top left dot and working only horizontally, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1 (only horizontally). You should now have 5 rows of 17 dots.
                <br><br>
                3. Starting at the top left dot, connect each dot in in row 1 to another dot in row 2.<br><br>
                4. Repeat step 3, connecting every dot in row 2 to another dot in row 3, row 3 to row 4, and row 4 to row 5.
              </p><br><hr><br>
              <p>Directions 3<br><br>

                1. Draw a 4x4 grid of dots in the middle of your paper (a little smaller than the width of your hand).<br><br>
                2. Starting from the top left dot and working only horizontally, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1 (only horizontally). You should now have 4 rows of 13 dots.
                <br><br>
                3. Draw a diagonal line connecting one dot in row 1 to another dot in row 2.<br><br>
                4. Draw a diagonal line going in the opposite direction connecting the same dot in row 2 to another dot in row 3 to create a zig zag.<br><br>
                5. Repeat step 4 connecting the dot in row 3 to a dot in row 4.
                <br><br>
                6. Connect the outermost dots to create an outline of your grid.
                <br><br>
                7. Draw parallel zig-zag lines only to the right of your original zig-zag, using the dots you drew to evenly space the lines. Each line should be contained within the outline of your grid.<br><br>

            <p>after going back and forth between drawing out some ideas and writing instructions, i tested some out with a friend and realized that a "curved" line can mean different things to different people:</p><br>

            <br>
            <p>in order to make it "easier" to follow, i tried to start out by creating a starting template of a grid.</p><br>

            <p>i realized it's hard to instruct people on drawing curves so i ended up changing my curved lines to straight lines in my instructions.</p><br>

            <p>jodi's infrastructure</p><br>
            <p>A line from the reading that I liked was”…the texture of code and computation takes over, and computing itself—its strange logic, its grammar and structure, and often its shape and color—produces the aesthetic,” in contrast to the idea of the artists' “subjective impulses” shaping the aesthetic of their work. Something that I find interesting about coding and working with mediums that I am less familiar with is being able to produce outcomes that I was not able to preconceive. This passage reminded me of working with code and seeing things in the console that I was not expecting, and I think it's cool that coding can produce outcomes that we as humans cannot create on our own.</p><br>
            <p>What interests me about the idea of 'generativity' is that it addresses something that I struggle with at times, which is making decisions about certain kinds of things. The idea of creating some kind of a system that reduces the need for “subjective impulses” or certain kinds of decision making is appealing in that it seems liberating in a way.</p><br>
            <p>I think it was really cool how Jodi used the infrastructure of the web in their work in ways I haven't seen before or even knew was possible. An example is their emoji animation in the browser address bar which reminded me of the Touch Bar on MacBook Pros. I learned something new because I never knew unicode characters could be used in domain names.

            <p>j.r. carpenter || a handmade web</p><br>
            <p>i liked how this reading talked about the intimacy of the handmade web page, and the idea of building a web page as a "craft" and "manual labor" - i felt it was particularly resonant as i was working on this web page because it took me a lot longer than i thought it would to achieve something that seems very simple and i found myself reworking things over and over again.</p><br>
            <p>also about the idea of manual labor, the surf-club reading made me think about how algorithms changed the way we "surf" the web, where everything is more spoonfed to us now. it reminded me that there was more of a sense of being able to get lost in the web that there is less of today.</p><br>
            <p>what i thought was also interesting from the surf-club reading was the contrast between the web today and the web in the early 2000s, especially the idea of ownership and what is public versus what is private on the web. i'm interested in learning more about NFTs and blockchain technology because admittedly i get confused, and i thought it was interesting how the idea of ownership has evolved.
