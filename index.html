            <p>reading response: game design - habraken</p><br>
            <p>It was really interesting to think about the idea of control in the context of games and how it relates to being a designer. While I know that there are game designers and designing games is an entire world and field in and of itself, I think this reading was the first time that I really thought about the connection between games and designing in general. I was reminded of collaborative work, especially now with tools like Figma or even Github which allows people to simultaneously work on the same project.</p><br>
            <p>The idea of “the physical designer’s skill [resting] on the ability to convey projected spatial arrangements through descriptions” was also interesting because I think it relates pretty directly to our recent experiment of designing instructions which presented various challenges in terms of how “accurately” others might interpret our intentions. I was also reminded of the idea of design systems particularly for branding, and how these are also in a sense instructions for people to follow with a level of specificity determined by the designer. The challenge here I think is also in how clear the system or guidelines are and how easy the system is for anybody to implement when the original designer is no longer overseeing it. I think these examples ultimately also all come back to the idea of communication, which is obviously at the root of what we study, which is communication design - how clearly can we communicate our intentions so that others may receive our message. </p>

            <p>p2 - revised instructions</p><br>
            <p>based on feedback from last class i revised my instructions, clarifying some steps and also changing some of the directions completely. for my 1st set of instructions, I modified the starting "grid" template to be more open while still maintaining consistency, as well as trying to eliminate sources of confusion (with unused points on the grid). I also brought color into the choice of medium which was suggested to make it more interesting.</p><br>
            <p>For the instructions 2 and 3, I decided to come up with new instructions as my first draft instructions were kind of similar to each other.</p><br>
            <p>revised instructions:</p><br>

            <p>e2 - instructions for paper</p><br>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I found in working on the instructions was controlling the variability in the outcomes. I think the more specific an outcome that I had in mind the more challenging it was to write the instructions in a way that another person would understand and interpret them the same way that I would. On the other hand I think it would be interesting to see how people might interpret a more open ended set of instructions, or perhaps some more poetic set of instructions like in Yoko Ono's Grapefruit. For my instructions, I decided to try and allow for some variability while still trying to create a sort of “template” or structure as a base for each execution.</p><br><hr><br>
            <p>Directions 1<br><br>

              1. Draw a “grid” of 5 dots by 5 dots in the middle of your paper (roughly the width of your hand). Do not connect any points yet.<br><br>
              2. Starting from the top left dot and working clockwise around the 4 sides of your grid, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1, to create an “outline” of dots.<br><br>
              3. Choose a dot on the top edge of your grid. Draw a line from this dot to every dot on the opposite side of your grid.<br><br>
              4. Choose a dot on the right edge of your grid. Draw a line from this dot to each dot on the opposite side.<br><br>
              5. Repeat for the bottom edge and finally the left edge.</p><br><hr><br>
              <p>Directions 2<br><br>

                1. Draw a “grid” of 5 dots by 5 dots in the middle of your paper (roughly the width of your hand). Do not connect any points yet.<br><br>
                2. Starting from the top left dot and working only horizontally, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1 (only horizontally). You should now have 5 rows of 17 dots.
                <br><br>
                3. Starting at the top left dot, connect each dot in in row 1 to another dot in row 2.<br><br>
                4. Repeat step 3, connecting every dot in row 2 to another dot in row 3, row 3 to row 4, and row 4 to row 5.
              </p><br><hr><br>
              <p>Directions 3<br><br>

                1. Draw a 4x4 grid of dots in the middle of your paper (a little smaller than the width of your hand).<br><br>
                2. Starting from the top left dot and working only horizontally, draw 3 more dots in between each of the dots you drew in Step 1 (only horizontally). You should now have 4 rows of 13 dots.
                <br><br>
                3. Draw a diagonal line connecting one dot in row 1 to another dot in row 2.<br><br>
                4. Draw a diagonal line going in the opposite direction connecting the same dot in row 2 to another dot in row 3 to create a zig zag.<br><br>
                5. Repeat step 4 connecting the dot in row 3 to a dot in row 4.
                <br><br>
                6. Connect the outermost dots to create an outline of your grid.
                <br><br>
                7. Draw parallel zig-zag lines only to the right of your original zig-zag, using the dots you drew to evenly space the lines. Each line should be contained within the outline of your grid.<br><br>

            <p>jodi's infrastructure</p><br>
            <p>A line from the reading that I liked was”…the texture of code and computation takes over, and computing itself—its strange logic, its grammar and structure, and often its shape and color—produces the aesthetic,” in contrast to the idea of the artists' “subjective impulses” shaping the aesthetic of their work. Something that I find interesting about coding and working with mediums that I am less familiar with is being able to produce outcomes that I was not able to preconceive. This passage reminded me of working with code and seeing things in the console that I was not expecting, and I think it's cool that coding can produce outcomes that we as humans cannot create on our own.</p><br>
            <p>What interests me about the idea of 'generativity' is that it addresses something that I struggle with at times, which is making decisions about certain kinds of things. The idea of creating some kind of a system that reduces the need for “subjective impulses” or certain kinds of decision making is appealing in that it seems liberating in a way.</p><br>
            <p>I think it was really cool how Jodi used the infrastructure of the web in their work in ways I haven't seen before or even knew was possible. An example is their emoji animation in the browser address bar which reminded me of the Touch Bar on MacBook Pros. I learned something new because I never knew unicode characters could be used in domain names.

            <p>j.r. carpenter || a handmade web</p><br>
            <p>i liked how this reading talked about the intimacy of the handmade web page, and the idea of building a web page as a "craft" and "manual labor" - i felt it was particularly resonant as i was working on this web page because it took me a lot longer than i thought it would to achieve something that seems very simple and i found myself reworking things over and over again.</p><br>
            <p>also about the idea of manual labor, the surf-club reading made me think about how algorithms changed the way we "surf" the web, where everything is more spoonfed to us now. it reminded me that there was more of a sense of being able to get lost in the web that there is less of today.</p><br>
            <p>what i thought was also interesting from the surf-club reading was the contrast between the web today and the web in the early 2000s, especially the idea of ownership and what is public versus what is private on the web. i'm interested in learning more about NFTs and blockchain technology because admittedly i get confused, and i thought it was interesting how the idea of ownership has evolved.
